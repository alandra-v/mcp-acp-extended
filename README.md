## Roadmap

**mcp-acp-extended** is Stage 2 of a three-stage architecture:

| Stage | Repository | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **1** | mcp-acp-core | Single-user proxy with policy engine, audit logging, HITL |
| **2** | mcp-acp-extended (this repo)| OAuth/OIDC integration, enhanced security features |
| **3** | mcp-acp-nexus | Advanced policies, multi-server support, mTLS |

Each stage builds upon the previous, sharing core abstractions while adding capabilities.
